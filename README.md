# gmail-web-scraping

## Information
This repository contains a Python web scraper to obtain the subject line
of a user's unread emails. The project encountered an issue where accounts 
with 2-factor-authentication could not be directly accessed, so I moved to 
using Google's API directly. The code is found in the working-code directory.


## Usage:
Paste the code from log_emails.gs and delete_emails.gs into a new project in 
script.google.com. This repository only serves as a manual version control.
